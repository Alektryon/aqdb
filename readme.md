Changes by @Alektryon, as of June 22, 2024:<br>
— Changed the default cipher from NAEQ (New Aeon English Qaballa) to AQ (Alphanumeric Qabbala): a continuous, non-redundant, alphanumeric sequence from 0 to Z=35.<br>
— Changed the original database to a list of different, selectable databases, as I think it's better not to be confined to a single database. The list of databases will eventually grow over time.<br>
