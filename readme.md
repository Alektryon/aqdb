Changes by @Alektryon, as of March 16, 2023:<br>
— Changed the default cipher from NAEQ (New Aeon English Qaballa) to AQ (Alphanumeric Qabbala): a continuous, non-redundant, alphanumeric sequence from 0 to Z=35.<br>
— Changed the database to my own, as I'm really not a fan of the database used in "naeq" (the same as in <a href="https://naeq.io/">NAEQ.io</a>), since most of its phrases don't seem to make sense. My database is <b>way</b> smaller (13K phrases instead of 86K), but in compensation, now all phrases in the database make sense.
